**Refactoring the existing code.**

1\. First we make assumptions about different types of partition keys that can be passed.

2\. Add a lot of test cases before refactoring.

2\. Simplify the multiple If statement for readability purposes. When the partition key is not provided using the hash generated from the event payload.

3\. Since the candidate would always be set, there's no point in having a conditional on line 17 and we can also remove the constant TRIVIAL\_PARTITION\_KEY since the candidate would always be set.
